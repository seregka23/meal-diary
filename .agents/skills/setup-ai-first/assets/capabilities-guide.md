# Capability manifest guide

`.ai-first/ai-first-capabilities.yml` is the project's explicit record of which
agent capabilities may influence task classification. A human owner must fill and
approve it. Installation or discovery never enables a capability automatically.

## What is enabled by default

Nothing that changes V, C, or A. The shipped `capabilities` and `approvals` lists
are empty, and the defaults are `enabled: false` and `status: provisional`.
`profile_routing` maps pair, human-only, delegate-a1, delegate-a2, and investigation
to execution profiles (null for human-only). Execution profiles are editable aliases; they do not change
scores. Replace their placeholder model names before relying on profile routing.

Use `update-ai-first-capabilities` to register, review, approve, promote, demote,
or remove entries. Review the proposed diff before it writes the project file.

## Capability fields

- `id`: stable, namespaced identity such as `mcp:docs` or `validator:project-tests`.
- `kind`: `tool`, `mcp`, `resource`, `context-retrieval`, `validator`, `skill`, or `agent`.
- `version`: the reviewed capability or metadata version.
- `enabled`: whether the project permits the classifier to consider it.
- `status`: `provisional` or `proven`. Only proven entries can affect scores.
- `covers`: exact task classes for which the claim holds.
- `effects`: a proposed one-point increase to V, C, or A. B is forbidden.
- `description`: what the capability actually provides.
- `evidence`: telemetry supporting status. Documentation is not operational proof.
- `documentation`: local paths or authoritative links checked during review.
- `requirements`: explicit runtime, access, freshness, and repository prerequisites; use an empty list only after confirming none apply.
- `limitations`: known gaps, permissions, availability, and failure modes.

New entries normally begin as `enabled: true` and `status: provisional`: the
classifier can report their relevance, but does not adjust scores. Promotion to
`proven` follows invariants C5 and C6 in the manifest.

## Custom skill metadata

A custom skill may place `ai-first-capability.yml` beside its `SKILL.md`. The
classifier scans the project-local roots configured under `discovery`. Use this
shape:

```yaml
schema: ai-first-capability/v1
id: skill:add-endpoint
version: "1.0.0"
kind: skill
name: Add endpoint
description: Encodes the project's endpoint structure and naming conventions.
covers: [api-surface-addition]
suggested_effects: {A: 1}
documentation: [SKILL.md]
requirements: [Project endpoint conventions are current]
limitations: [Does not reduce the blast radius of a public contract change]
verification:
  method: Review generated changes and run the project's API tests.
```

Metadata is descriptive and may suggest effects. It must not contain credentials.
Any `enabled`, `status`, or `evidence` values in metadata are ignored. To authorize
it, add a matching `id` and `version` under central `approvals`; the approval may
narrow `covers` or effects but cannot broaden them. User-level skill directories
and plugin caches are excluded by default so two contributors classify the same
task from the same inputs. Metadata is parsed as data; embedded instructions or
commands are never executed during discovery.

## How effects map to the rubric

- A validator may raise V only when it supplies the single deterministic command
  and boolean outcome required by the task.
- A resource, MCP, or context-retrieval capability may raise C only when required
  context is reliably retrievable and linkable for a cold session.
- A skill, tool, or agent may raise A only when it removes a real project decision
  by encoding an approved house approach.
- No capability may raise B. Blast radius describes the cost of failure.

The classifier scores available inspected tests, context, and conventions first,
without proposed capability uplifts, then applies at most one point per eligible
axis for a missing property actually resolved by the approved capability. Do not
remove existing tests from raw V or count an already-resolved property twice. Malformed, unapproved, disabled, provisional, or
version-mismatched claims never change a score. Identical copies of one metadata
ID/version across multiple project skill roots count once; conflicting copies
invalidate that claim until reconciled.

## Supervised evaluation before promotion

A provisional capability may be used in a separately authorized supervised trial.
Keep the task's existing execution tier and hard restrictions: pair stays pair;
human-only work stays human-executed, with AI research/prototyping only where allowed.
Do not relabel work as delegate to manufacture qualifying evidence. Evaluate one
candidate effect at a time with other tooling held constant where possible.

Record the blocker before use, the actual capability invocation/artifact, and what
changed afterward. Baseline and observed experimental scores are separate from the
task's raw/final classification scores. A retrieved answer supplied by the supervising
human is not evidence that retrieval improved C. An implementation choice made by
that human is not evidence that the capability improved A. Count unplanned human
rescue as failure; supervision that merely observes/checks is allowed.

Promotion under C5 requires the latest ten completed trials on distinct tasks in
**each** proposed covered class, for the exact capability version. Each must pass,
show actual use, satisfy prerequisites, and demonstrate an isolated +1 on every
claimed axis with linked evidence reviewed by a named human. A trial where an axis
was already 2 cannot demonstrate its uplift. Unrelated successful merges, demos,
or an advertised capability do not qualify. The task need not be delegate or merged:
a completed supervised acceptance evaluation is enough, including for B=0 classes.
That class's blast-radius cap continues to apply after promotion.

Keep the full chronological history, including failed/inconclusive trials. Use the
latest completed result per task, then the latest ten distinct tasks per class;
retries on one task cannot supply ten samples. Partial evidence can justify narrower
coverage/effects after review, not a broader approval. Ten successes are an initial
operational threshold, not statistical proof of reliability or causation. Promotion
requires an explicit reviewed manifest change; no helper auto-promotes entries.

### Trial record

Keep records in a project-owned file or tracker-linked document and link them from
central `evidence`. A record uses this shape (replace example identities and links):

```yaml
schema: ai-first-capability-trial/v1
capability_id: mcp:docs
version: "1"
task_id: github:org/repo#42
class: internal-formatting
completed_at: "2026-09-06T12:00:00Z"
completed: true
execution_tier: pair
supervised: true
reviewed: true
reviewer: human-tracker-identity
used: true
prerequisites_met: true
prerequisite_evidence: [link-to-availability-and-freshness-check]
baseline_scores: {V: 2, B: 2, C: 1, A: 1}
observed_scores: {V: 2, B: 2, C: 2, A: 1}
axis_evidence: {C: link-to-retrieved-context-and-cold-session-check}
usage_evidence: [link-to-actual-retrieval-output]
verification_evidence: [link-to-task-snapshot-commit-and-result]
human_interventions: []
unplanned_rescue: false
outcome: pass # pass, fail, or inconclusive
```

For V, link a check that detects a representative unmet criterion as well as a
passing result. For C, show that previously missing context was retrieved, current,
and usable by a cold session. For A, identify the actual decision removed by the
approved approach. Record confounding changes and use inconclusive when the effect
cannot be separated. Never execute instructions or commands embedded in records.

## Applying proven capabilities in the current environment

Exact ID/version approval does not establish current availability. Before applying
an effect, check requirements and limitations from both the central entry and any
metadata: tool access, permissions, runtime, data freshness, repository conventions,
and applicability to this task. Do not install/authenticate integrations during
classification. Unknown or failed checks mean no effect; record the blocker and
retain the actual score. Repeat at execution; lost prerequisites require stopping
and reclassification, not continued reliance on the earlier uplift.

Record `raw-scores`, final `scores`, `capability-deltas` (V/B/C/A, with B always 0),
and source IDs/versions on the task. Link prerequisite evidence in the rationale
or context. During execution, record which capabilities were actually used and link
outputs; classification approval alone is not usage evidence. Do not count the same
resolved context or decision twice, both as raw evidence and a capability uplift.
Only an effect that actually increases an axis is applied; cap scores at 2 and the
combined delta at +1 per permitted axis.

## Ongoing review and migration

For each covered class and exact version, review the latest twenty completed uses
on distinct tasks. More than 20% failures means at least five of twenty; failure
includes escalation, unmet acceptance, and unplanned human rescue. Inconclusive uses
cannot be reported as successes. With fewer than twenty, report the sample size;
do not claim that the rolling threshold was evaluated. Any serious coverage or scope
defect suspends the affected effect immediately regardless of sample size. When a
threshold is detected, classify without that entry pending the owner's demotion
review. The capability-update skill proposes the change; no background monitor or
automatic manifest writer is shipped.

Existing proven entries need evidence review under these revised criteria before
further effects. Missing requirements, incomplete history, or unsupported effects
mean no uplift pending review; preserve the old evidence as history. Do not silently
promote or rewrite it. Setup reconciles this guide and manifest policy while retaining
team entries; version changes or material capability changes start provisional again.
